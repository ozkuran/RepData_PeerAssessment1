## Introduction

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

### 1. Load the data

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
## Summary of unprocessed data
summary(activity)
```

At a first look a total of **17568 observations** and **2304 NA** available in data.

### 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

For easier process of data later changes type of "date" column to Date.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Convert Date Column to Date type
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

### 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Load GGPLOT2 Library
library(ggplot2)
## Extract data for Steps Per Day Histogram
stepsperday<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,sum)
## Summary of Summed data
summary(stepsperday)
## Save Histogram as PNG
png(filename="figure/001.png")
## Print Histogram of Steps Per Day
hist(stepsperday,xlab="Steps",main="Steps Per Day Histogram",labels=T)
## Close Device
dev.off()
```

### 2. Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day
```{r echo=TRUE}
## Calculate Mean Steps Per Day
meanOrg <- mean(stepsperday, na.rm=T)
meanOrg
## Calculate Median Steps Per Day
medianOrg <- median(stepsperday, na.rm=T)
medianOrg
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. `type = "l"`) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Extract data for Steps Per 5 Minute Time Series Plot
stepsPer5MinutesAverage<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$interval,mean,na.rm=T)
intervals <- sort(unique(activity$interval,na.rm=T))
## Save Time Series Plot as PNG
png(filename="figure/002.png")
## Print Steps Per 5 Minute Time Series Plot
plot(intervals,stepsPer5MinutesAverage,type="l")
## Close Device
dev.off()
```

### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Interval with biggest mean
highestMeanInterval <- as.numeric(names(which.max(stepsPer5MinutesAverage)) )
highestMeanInterval
```

## Inputing missing values

### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with `NA`s)

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Total Missing Data
missingDataCountSteps <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
missingDataCountDate <- sum(is.na(activity$date))
missingDataCountInterval <- sum(is.na(activity$interval))
missingDataCountSteps
missingDataCountDate
missingDataCountInterval
```

### 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 

Decided to use already calculated for plot 5 Minute Average Data.

### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Initialize Clean Data
cleanData <- activity
## Replace NA's with mean
for(i in 1:nrow(cleanData)){
  if(is.na(cleanData[i,]$steps)){
    cleanData[i,]$steps<-stepsPer5MinutesAverage[i]
  }
}
```

### 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Create Average Clean Data
stepsperdayClean<-tapply(cleanData$steps,cleanData$date,sum)
## Save Histogram as PNG
png(filename="figure/003.png")
## Print Histogram of Steps Per Day (Clean)
hist(stepsperdayClean,xlab="Steps",main="Steps Per Day Histogram",labels=T)
## Close Device
dev.off()
```

![Steps Per Day After NA's Filled With Mean](figure/003.png) 

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Calculate Mean Steps Per Day
meanClean <- mean(stepsperdayClean, na.rm=T)
meanClean
## Calculate Median Steps Per Day
medianClean <- median(stepsperdayClean, na.rm=T)
medianClean
```

As mean selected as filler for NA data. Mean value does not chane and change median is negligible.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Added a new column named **day** to **cleanData** which holds day of the week. And then classified those days as **weekday** and **weekend**.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Find Weekdays and Weekends
cleanData$day <- format(cleanData$date, "%A")
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Monday"] <- "weekday"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Tuesday"] <- "weekday"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Wednesday"] <- "weekday"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Thursday"] <- "weekday"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Friday"] <- "weekday"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Saturday"] <- "weekend"
cleanData$day[cleanData$day == "Sunday"] <- "weekend"
```

Created 2 different data sets to hold Weekend and Weekday data.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Create Weekday Data
cleanWDData <- cleanData[which(cleanData$day == "weekday"),]
## Create Weekend Data
cleanWEData <- cleanData[which(cleanData$day == "weekend"),]
```

Drawn graph of weekday and weekend average values.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## Weekday-Weekend Difference Graph
library(lattice)
meanStepsByWEWD <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data = cleanData, mean)
## Save Time Series Plot as PNG
png(filename="figure/004.png")
## Print Steps Per 5 Minute Time Series Plot
xyplot(steps ~ interval | factor(day), meanStepsByWEWD, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2))
## Close Device
dev.off()
```
